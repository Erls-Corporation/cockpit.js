This folder contains the demos.

NOTE: The cockpit image is taken from http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/File:Hind_Cockpit_BO.png
and slightly modified. It's only here for demo purposes. It's very probably
copyrighted, so I'd strongly advise to not use it in real world projects.

NOTE: The demo found in the 'three' folder is a modified version of the
three.js demo that can be found here:
